* VHDL Tools

Vhdl-tools provide a minor mode intended to be used under [[https://guest.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~zimmi/emacs/vhdl-mode.html][vhdl-mode]].
It adds specific functionality on top of [[https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags][ggtags]], =imenu= and =outline=
to ease navigating vhdl sources. It expects a working setup of =ggtags=,
completing it with

  - Jumping into instances
  - Jump to upper level
  - Searching for references
  - Link management
  - Custom use of imenu

* Install

As usual: add to path and require after loading =vhdl-mode=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'vhdl-mode
    (add-to-list 'load-path "...")
    (require 'vhdl-tools))
#+end_src

Then, activate the minor mode by completing the =vhdl-mode= hook.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'vhdl-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (vhdl-tools-mode 1)))
#+end_src

* Use

The following keybinds are available

  + =C-c M-D=, jumps to the definition of symbol at point
  + =C-c M-j=, follows the link at point
  + =C-c M-w=, stores a link
  + =C-c M-y=, pastes a link
  + =C-c M-.=, jumps into the instance at point

    [[file:JumpIntoInstance.gif][JumpIntoInstance.gif]]

  + =C-c M-a=, moves point to first appearance of symbol at point
  + =C-c M-u=, jumps to upper hierarchy level

Cursor will jump to the target if there is one, searching packages too. The ring
mark is push after jumping, so to get back, press =C-c C-p= or M-, (default
binds under =ggtags=) if corresponding definition has been found. Works better
for files with correct syntax: think =vhdl-beautify-buffer= before using
=vhdl-tools=.

Also have a look at customization possibilities with =M-x customize-group vhdl-tools=.
