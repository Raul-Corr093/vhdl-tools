* VHDL Tools

Utilities to ease navigating vhdl sources, based on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/vhdl-goto-def.el][vhdl-goto-def]].

- Jumping into instances
- Jump to upper level
- Searching for references
- Link management
- Custom use of imenu

* Install

As usual, add to path and require.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'vhdl-mode
    (add-to-list 'load-path "...")
    (require 'vhdl-tools))
#+end_src

* Use

Activate the minor mode by completing the vhdl mode hook.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'vhdl-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (vhdl-tools-mode 1))
#+end_src

This will make available a set of keys:

  + =C-c M-D=, jumps to the definition of symbol at point
  + =C-c M-j=, follows the link at point
  + =C-c M-w=, stores a link
  + =C-c M-y=, pastes a link
  + =C-c M-.=, jumps into the instance at point
  + =C-c M-a=, moves point to first appearance of symbol at point
  + =C-c M-u=, jumps to uppers hierarchy level
